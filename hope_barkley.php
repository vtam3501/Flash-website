					 Hi, my name is Hope Barkley and I am a digital media studies student at the University of Rochester. I grew up in Tarrytown, NY, a suburb about 30 minutes outside of New York City. I started gymnastics when I was 7 years-old. Before going to college, I reached USAG level 9 gymnastics and competed on a State and Regional level. I am currently majoring in Digital Media Studies, an interdisciplinary major focussing on technology industries, and hope to pursue a career in design or web development post graduation.

			<h2>Academic Story</h2>
			<p>
				I attended Solomon Schechter School of Westchester, a Jewish day school located in Hartsdale, New Yorkï¼Œ and was a competetive gymnast throughout my high school career.
			</p>
			<p>
				At University of Rochester, I have taken many classes to help advance my skillsets and knowledge. I have completed courses such as DMS 101, DMS 102, DMS 103, and DMS 104 to ensure that I am prepared for upper level DMS classes. Additionally, I am one course away from completion of my computer science minor, and now have HTML, Python and Java skills. I am currently enrolled in many Business courses, such as Finance, and have previously taken multiple Economics and accounting classes.

			<h2>Experience </h2>

			<p>
				I have had a variety of internships and jobs throughout my life. My first job was as a gymnastics coach at Westchester Gymnastics, where I taught to beginners. I spent the summer of 2016 working as the gymnastics coordinator for a day camp run by the Jewish Community Center of Tarrytown, where I worked with over 300 children every day teaching basic gymnastics skills.
			</p>
			<p>
				 In the summer of 2017 following my Freshmen year of college, I worked in the User Experience Design department of Mastercard in NYC, and got the chance to work on a variety of exciting projects such as the redesign of MC's website, apps and conduct multiple research tests. This past summer, I was a graphic design intern for Regeneron, a biotechnology company located in Tarrytown NY.  In this position, I helped run and manage many of their social media campaigns, create designs for corporate materials, and learned a great deal about marketing within the heathcare industry.

			<h2>One interesting experience I want to share</h2>

			<p>
				Last semester, I was a teaching assistant for Economics 207, an intermediate microeconomics course taught by Professor Rizzo. As part of my responsiblities I graded Problem sets, exams, and help develop the course scope. I really enjoyed this course when I took it and loved the chance to teach other students. This semester I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science department in an introduction to Python course, CSC 161 taught by Professor Sarkis. I really loved the problem solving aspect of the labs, and so I decided to serve as a lab TA for the course. Weekly, I run two lab sessions for upwards of 50 students and answer questions on their homework assignments.
