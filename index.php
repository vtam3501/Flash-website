        Hi, my name is Hope Barkley and I am a digital media studies student at the University of Rochester. I grew up in Tarrytown, NY, a suburb about 30 minutes outside of New York City. I attended Solomon Schechter School of Westchester, a Jewish day school located in Hartsdale, New York. I started gymnastics when I was 7 years-old and was a competetive gymnast throughout my high school career, before deciding not to pursue it in college. Before going to college, I reached USAG level 9 gymnastics and competed on a State and Regional level. During my senior year of high school I applied Early Decision to the University of Rochester and was accepted! I am currently majoring in Digital Media Studies, an interdisciplinary major focussing on technology industries, and hope to pursue a career in design or web development post graduation.
