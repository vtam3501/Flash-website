## About our Website

### Ontology:
* The three studnets in team Tokyo are all from the University of Rochester who are all interested in the web design area

* They are all from the East Coast of America. 

* They all tried their best to explore their life with possibilities, seeking their career interests in the Web design or digital media area.

### Taxonomy:
* The website contains one home page and three biography pages.

* In the home page, we present each team member with their names, their pictures and a short introduction. By clicking the picture, the reader will go to the person's biograph page on this website.

* The introduction is a small taste for readers to have an overview about the peroson before they see their initial website and their biographic page.

* Below the introduction, there is a link to their inital website.

### Choreography: 

* Our home page that introducing each member of team Tokyo is following the order of their last name Alphabatically and so is the navigation order.

* On the biography page, the student's name is listed in the top center of the page so that it draws the attention, and shows the person that is page is talking about. 

* The information structure of the biographyt website is shaped from large information scale(general information) to small and specific perosonal story. 

* We indroduce the person's "brief introduction" first, then the "Academic story" and "Experience", which focus on these specific areas, and at last"One interesting story I want to share" which is about the personal story.
