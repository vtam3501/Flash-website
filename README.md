## About our Website

### Ontology:

This flash-website is aiming to introduce three studnets from the University of Rochester who are all interested in the web design area and are from the East Coast. They try their best to explore their life with possibilities, seeking their career interests in the Web design or digital media area.

### Taxonomy:
We start each person's initial website by the "Brief Introduction part", then the "Academic Story", after that is the "Experience" mainly talk about their internship, at last is the "One Interesting Experience I want to share".

### Choreography: 
We start the home page by introducing each member of team Tokyo following the order of their last name Alphabatically.
We also set the order of the navigation the same as the home page. (Alphabatical in Last name).
