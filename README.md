## About our Website

### Ontology:

* They are all from the East Coast of America. 
* They all tried their best to explore their life with possibilities, seeking their career interests in the Web design or digital media area.

### Taxonomy:
* We start each person's initial website by the "Brief Introduction part", then the "Academic Story", after that is the "Experience" mainly talk about their internship, at last is the "One Interesting Experience I want to share".
* Our home page that introducing each member of team Tokyo is following the order of their last name Alphabatically.
* We also set the order of the navigation the same as the home page. (Alphabatical in Last name).


### Choreography: 
* Generally speaking, we shape the information structure for this website from large information size to small and specific perosonal story. 
* In the brief intoduction part, we give the readers a overview of the person on the page, which information is very general.
* In the second part, "Academic Story", we show the person's academic history and his/her academic interests. In this part, we focus on only the academic side.
* In the thrid part, "Experience", we states the person's intership or job experience, to show how they are preparing for the coming future. In this part, se focus on only the intership part.
* In the last "One Interesting Experience I Want to share" Part, we ask the group member each to tell an interesting story that happens in their internship. This part is about the very specific personal story.
